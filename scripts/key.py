"""Chroma-key the fixed magenta background off a Flow element and write a
transparent PNG.

Why magenta and not white: white keying can only remove background that is
connected to the image border, so an enclosed white region is ambiguous -- the
phone's screen must stay, the hourglass frame's gaps must go, and nothing in
the pixels says which is which. A background colour the object never contains
removes that ambiguity: every magenta pixel is background, inside or outside.

# "Magenta-ness": how far red AND blue both sit above green. Pure magenta
# scores 255. Every colour in the VOX palette scores at or below zero --
# cream -12, coral -15, muted blue -36, terracotta -34, black/grey/white 0 --
# so this separates background from subject far more cleanly than Euclidean
# distance to the key colour, which was still passing dark magenta JPEG fringe
# through and despilling it into a navy outline.

# truck's handrail, the crane's lattice) has its chroma contaminated by JPEG's

# what separates it from true background. The thresholds cannot be constants:
# the model does not always render the same magenta -- most images come back at
# saturation ~253, but the dunes came back at 155, and fixed thresholds then
# read that whole background as "dull magenta" and restored it as a grey slab.
